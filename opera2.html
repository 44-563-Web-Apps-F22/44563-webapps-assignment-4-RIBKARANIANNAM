  <h4 class="ALEX">ALEX. </h4>          Oh, joyous boon!
 <h4 class="DR">DR. D.  </h4>            Oh, mad delight!
 <h4 class="ALEX">ALEX. </h4>                           Oh, sun and moon!
  <h4 class="DR">DR. D.  </h4>               Oh, day and night!
  <h4 class="SIR">SIR M.  </h4>           Ye birds, and brooks, and fruitful trees,
                    With choral joy, delight the breeze—
                    Rejoice, rejoice with me!


<h4 class="ALEX">ALEX.   </h4>         No young giddy thoughtless maiden,
                    Full of graces, airs, and jeers—
               But a sober widow, laden
                    With the weight of fifty years!

<h4 class="SIR">SIR M.  </h4>          No high-born exacting beauty
                    Blazing like a jewelled sun—
               But a wife who'll do her duty,
                    As that duty should be done!

<h4 class="MRS">MRS. P. </h4>          I'm no saucy minx and giddy—
                    Hussies such as them abound—
               But a clean and tidy widdy
                    Well be-known for miles around!
<h4 class="DR">DR.D.   </h4>          All the village now have mated,
                    All are happy as can be—
               I to live alone am fated:
                    No one's left to marry me!

<h4 class="MRS">MRS. P. </h4>         She will tend him etc.

<h4 class="SIR">SIR M. </h4>   (with stately courtesy)
              Welcome joy, adieu to sadness!

<h4 class="CONST">CONST. </h4> As Aurora gilds the day,
              So those eyes, twin orbs of gladness,
                    Chase the clouds of care away.
