<h4>ACT I—Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Mid-day</h4>

<pre>
    <h5>ACT I.
      SCENE—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's Elizabethan Mansion, mid-day.</h5>
    
   <p> CHORUS OF VILLAGERS
    
    Ring forth, ye bells,
    With clarion sound—
    Forget your knells,
    For joys abound.
    Forget your notes
    Of mournful lay,
    And from your throats
    Pour joy to-day.
    
            For to-day young Alexis—young Alexis Pointdextre
            Is betrothed to Aline—to Aline Sangazure,
            And that pride of his sex is—of his sex is to be next her
            At the feast on the green—on the green, oh, be sure!
    
            Ring forth, ye bells etc.</p>
           <p>(Exeunt the men into house.)</p>
    
     <p> (Enter Mrs. Partlet with Constance, her daughter)</p>
    
                        <p>  RECITATIVE
    
       <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                      Constance, my daughter, why this strange depression?
                      The village rings with seasonable joy,
                      Because the young and amiable Alexis,
                      Heir to the great Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre,
                      Is plighted to Aline, the only daughter
                      Of Annabella, Lady Sangazure.
                      You, you alone are sad and out of spirits;
                      What is the reason?  Speak, my daughter, speak!
    
        <h4>CON.</h4>                  Oh, mother, do not ask!  If my complexion
                  From red to white should change in quick succession,
                  And then from white to red, oh, take no notice!
                  If my poor limbs should tremble with emotion,
                  Pay no attention, mother—it is nothing!
                  If long and deep-drawn sighs I chance to utter,
                  Oh, heed them not, their cause must ne'er be known!
    
<h4> Mrs. </h4>                   Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance.  Exeunt
                   ladies of Chorus.</p>
    
                     <p>   ARIA—CONSTANCE
    
                        When he is here,
                        I sigh with pleasure—
                        When he is gone,
                        I sigh with grief.
                        My hopeless fear
                        No soul can measure—
                        His love alone
                        Can give my aching heart relief!
    
                        When he is cold,
                        I weep for sorrow—
                        When he is kind,
                        I weep for joy.
                        My grief untold
                        Knows no to-morrow—
                        My woe can find
                        No hope, no solace, no alloy!</p>
    
      <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                  Come, tell me all about it!  Do not fear—
                  I, too, have loved; but that was long ago!
                  Who is the object of your young affections?
      <h4>CONST.</h4>            Hush, mother!  He is here!  (Looking off)
    
            Enter Dr. Daly.  He is pensive and does not see them
    
      <h4>MRS. P.</h4>     (amazed) Our reverend vicar!
      <h4>CONST.</h4>      Oh, pity me, my heart is almost broken!
      <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                  My child, be comforted.  To such an union
                  I shall not offer any opposition.
                  Take him—he's yours!  May you and he be happy!
      <h4>CONST.</h4>      But, mother dear, he is not yours to give!
      <h4> MRS. P.</h4>     That's true, indeed!
     <h4>CONST.</h4>       He might object!
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                  He might.
                  But come—take heart—I'll probe him on the subject.
                  Be comforted—leave this affair to me.
                 (They withdraw.)
    
                           <p>RECITATIVE—DR. DALY
    
                  The air is charged with amatory numbers—
                  Soft madrigals, and dreamy lovers' lays.
                  Peace, peace, old heart!  Why waken from its slumbers
                  The aching memory of the old, old days?</p>
    
                                   BALLAD
    
                Time was when Love and I were well acquainted.
                Time was when we walked ever hand in hand.
                A saintly youth, with worldly thought untainted,
                None better-loved than I in all the land!
                Time was, when maidens of the noblest station,
                Forsaking even military men,
                Would gaze upon me, rapt in adoration—
                Ah me, I was a fair young curate then!
    
                Had I a headache? sighed the maids assembled;
                Had I a cold? welled forth the silent tear;
                Did I look pale? then half a parish trembled;
                And when I coughed all thought the end was near!
                I had no care—no jealous doubts hung o'er me—
                For I was loved beyond all other men.
                Fled gilded dukes and belted earls before me—
                Ah me, I was a pale young curate them!
    
      <p>(At the conclusion of the ballad, Mrs. Partlet comes forward with
      Constance.)</p>
    
        <h4>MRS. P.</h4>    Good day, reverend sir.
        <h4>DR. D.</h4>                   Ah, good Mrs. Partlet, I am glad to see you.  And
                   your little daughter, Constance!  Why, she is quite a little
                   woman, I declare!
        <h4>CONST.</h4>     (aside)  Oh, mother, I cannot speak to him!
        <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                   Yes, reverend sir, she is nearly eighteen, and as
                   good a girl as ever stepped.  (Aside to Dr. Daly)  Ah, sir, I'm
                   afraid I shall soon lose her!
        <h4>DR. D.</h4>                   (aside to Mrs. Partlet)  Dear me, you pain me very
                    much.  Is she delicate?
        <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                    Oh no, sir—I don't mean that—but young girls look
                    to get married.
       <h4> DR. D.</h4>                    Oh, I take you.  To be sure.  But there's plenty of
                    time for that.  Four or five years hence, Mrs. Partlet, four or
                    five years hence.  But when the time does come, I shall have much
                    pleasure in marrying her myself—
        <h4>CONST.</h4>      (aside)  Oh, mother!
        <h4>DR. D.</h4>      To some strapping young fellow in her own rank of life.
        <h4>CONST.</h4>      (in tears)  He does not love me!
       <h4> MRS. P.</h4>                      I have often wondered, reverend sir (if you'll
                    excuse the liberty), that you have never married.
        <h4>DR. D.</h4>      (aside)  Be still, my fluttering heart!
        <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                    A clergyman's wife does so much good in a village.
                    besides that, you are not as young as you were, and before very
                    long you will want somebody to nurse you, and look after your
                    little comforts.
       <h4> DR. D.</h4>                    Mrs. Partlet, there is much truth in what you say.
                    I am indeed getting on in years, and a helpmate would cheer my
                    declining days.  Time was when it might have been; but I have
                    left it too long—I am an old fogy, now, am I not, my dear?  (to
                    Constance)—a very old fogy, indeed.  Ha! ha!  No, Mrs. Partlet,
                    my mind is quite made up.  I shall live and die a solitary old
                    bachelor.
        <h4>CONST.</h4>      Oh, mother, mother!  (Sobs on Mrs. Partlet's bosom)
        <h4>MRS. P.</h4>                    Come, come, dear one, don't fret.  At a more
                    fitting time we will try again—we will try again.
                    (Exeunt Mrs. Partlet and Constance.)
    
       <h4> DR. D.</h4>                    (looking after them)  Poor little girl!  I'm afraid
                    she has something on her mind.  She is rather comely.  Time was
                    when this old heart would have throbbed in double-time at the
                    sight of such a fairy form!  But tush!  I am puling!  Here comes
                    the young Alexis with his proud and happy father.  Let me dry
                    this tell-tale tear!
    
                       Enter Sir Marmaduke and Alexis
    
                            <p>       RECITATIVE
    
      <h4>DR. D.</h4>                  Sir Marmaduke—my dear young friend, Alexis—
                  On this most happy, most auspicious plighting—
                  Permit me as a true old friend to tender
                  My best, my very best congratulations!
      <h4>SIR M.</h4>      Sir, you are most obleeging!
      <h4>ALEX.</h4>                  Dr. Daly
                  My dear old tutor, and my valued pastor,
                  I thank you from the bottom of my heart!
                 <p> (Spoken through music)</p>
      <h4>DR. D.</h4>                  May ortune bless you! may the middle distance
                  Of your young life be pleasant as the foreground—
                  The joyous foreground! and, when you have reached it,
                  May that which now is the far-off horizon
                  (But which will then become the middle distance),
                  In fruitful promise be exceeded only
                  By that which will have opened, in the meantime,
                  Into a new and glorious horizon!
      <h4>SIR M.</h4>                  Dear Sir, that is an excellent example
                  Of an old school of stately compliment
                  To which I have, through life, been much addicted.
                  Will you obleege me with a copy of it,
                  In clerkly manuscript, that I myself
                  May use it on appropriate occasions?
      <h4>SIR M</h4>                  Sir, you shall have a fairly-written copy
                  Ere Sol has sunk into his western slumbers!
                 (Exit Dr. Daly)
    
      <h4>SIR M.</h4>                   (to Alexis, who is in a reverie)  Come, come, my
                   son—your fiancee will be here in five minutes.  Rouse yourself
                   to receive her.
                   ALEXIS  Oh rapture!
      <h4>SIR M.</h4>                   Yes, you are a fortunate young fellow, and I will
                   not disguise from you that this union with the House of Sangazure
                   realizes my fondest wishes.  Aline is rich, and she comes of a
                   sufficiently old family, for she is the seven thousand and
                   thirty-seventh in direct descent from Helen of Troy.  True, there
                   was a blot on the escutcheon of that lady—that affair with
                   Paris—but where is the family, other than my own, in which there
                   is no flaw?  You are a lucky fellow, sir—a very lucky fellow!
                   ALEXIS  Father, I am welling over with limpid joy!  No
                   sicklying taint of sorrow overlies the lucid lake of liquid love,
                   upon which, hand in hand, Aline and I are to float into eternity!
      <h4>SIR M. </h4>                   Alexis, I desire that of your love for this young
                   lady you do not speak so openly.  You are always singing ballads
                   in praise of her beauty, and you expect the very menials who wait
                   behind your chair to chorus your ecstasies.  It is not delicate.
                   ALEXIS  Father, a man who loves as I love—
      <h4>SIR M. </h4>                    Pooh pooh, sir! fifty years ago I madly loved your
                    future mother-in-law, the Lady Sangazure, and I have reason to
                    believe that she returned my love.  But were we guilty of the
                    indelicacy of publicly rushing into each other's arms,
                    exclaiming—
    
                  "Oh, my adored one!" "Beloved boy!"
                  "Ecstatic rapture!" "Unmingled joy!"</p>
    
      which seems to be the modern fashion of love-making?  No! it was
      "Madam, I trust you are in the enjoyment of good health"—"Sir,
      you are vastly polite, I protest I am mighty well"—and so forth.
      Much more delicate—much more respectful.  But see—Aline
      approaches—let us retire, that she may compose herself for the
      interesting ceremony in which she is to play so important a part.
        (Exeunt Sir Marmaduke and Alexis.)
    
           <p>(Enter Aline on terrace, preceded by Chorus of Girls.)</p>
    
                           <p>   CHORUS OF GIRLS
    
                             With heart and with voice
                             Let us welcome this mating:
                             To the youth of her choice,
                             With a heart palpitating,
                             Comes the lovely Aline!
    
                             May their love never cloy!
                             May their bliss me unbounded!
                             With a halo of joy
                             May their lives be surrounded!
                             Heaven bless our Aline!</p>

     <p>(Those who have partaken of the philtre struggle in vain against its effects, and, at the end of the chorus, fall insensible on the stage.)</p>
